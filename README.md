# ColorClassifyPlus

Enhance your understanding of ML Models for Color and Image Classification with ColorClassifyPlus.

## Technologies Utilized

* PyTorch
* sklearn

## Overview

Welcome to the ColorClassifyPlus repository, where I showcase my endeavors in exploring the potential of the PyTorch framework. This repository encompasses three distinct models designed to broaden your insights into machine learning techniques:

1. **LinearRegression**
   Dive into the world of linear regression, grasping its concepts and applications.

2. **Classification on make_blobs and make_circles Datasets**
   Explore classification techniques using the renowned datasets from sklearn: `make_blobs` and `make_circles`.

3. **Image Classification on FashionMNIST Dataset**
   Embark on an image classification journey using the FashionMNIST dataset, a benchmark in the field.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these models to your own projects. Your journey into the realm of machine learning starts here!
